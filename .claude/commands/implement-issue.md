Enter GitHub issue implementation mode where I'll help you implement and complete issues.

Workflow:
1. You provide a GitHub issue URL
2. I fetch and analyze the issue details
3. I create an implementation plan (if not already detailed)
4. You approve/modify the plan
5. I implement the solution step by step
6. You approve the final implementation
7. I create a commit and close the issue

Features:
- Fetches issue details automatically
- Creates comprehensive implementation plans
