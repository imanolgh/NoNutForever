## Detailed Setup Steps Performed

### 1. Initial Laravel and React Native Installation

**Technology Decisions Made:**
- **Backend**: Laravel 12.0 - Chosen for its modern PHP framework with excellent API development capabilities
- **Frontend**: React Native with Expo SDK 54.0.9 - Selected for cross-platform mobile development
- **Database**: SQLite - Lightweight database suitable for development and small applications
- **Package Manager**: Composer for PHP, npm for JavaScript/TypeScript

**Installation Steps:**
1. Created Laravel 12 application in `backend/nonutforever-api/`
2. Set up React Native/Expo application in `frontend/nonutforever-reactnative/`
3. Configured both applications with modern development practices

### 2. Git Repository Management and .gitignore Implementation

**Problem Identified:**
The initial setup accidentally committed 3,566+ dependency files (node_modules, vendor directories) which should not be tracked in version control.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created comprehensive root-level `.gitignore` file with the following exclusions:
  ```
  # Dependencies
  /vendor/
  /node_modules/

  # Composer
  /composer.lock

  # IDE
  /.idea/
  /.vscode/
  *.swp
  *.swo

  # OS
  .DS_Store
  Thumbs.db

  # Environment
  .env
  .env.local
  .env.*.local
  ```

**Git Cleanup Process:**
1. Removed all accidentally tracked node_modules files
2. Removed vendor directory files from tracking
3. Applied gitignore rules to prevent future tracking of dependency directories
4. Committed changes with descriptive message explaining the cleanup

**Why This Was Important:**
- Reduces repository size significantly
- Prevents merge conflicts in dependency files
- Follows best practices for version control
- Improves clone and fetch performance

### 3. Backend Configuration (Laravel 12)

**Key Dependencies Added:**
```json
{
  "require": {
    "php": "^8.2",
    "laravel/framework": "^12.0",
    "laravel/tinker": "^2.10.1"
  },
  "require-dev": {
    "laravel/boost": "^1.2",          // Laravel Boost for enhanced development
    "laravel/pint": "^1.24",          // Code formatting
    "phpunit/phpunit": "^11.5.3"      // Testing framework
  }
}
```

**Custom Composer Scripts Configured:**
- `composer run dev`: Concurrent development server with queue, logs, and Vite
- `composer run test`: Clear config and run PHPUnit tests
- `composer run format`: Format code using Laravel Pint
- `composer run check`: Format, test, and list routes

**Laravel Boost Integration:**
- Added Laravel Boost MCP (Model-Context Protocol) integration
- Created `.mcp.json` configuration file for enhanced Claude Code integration
- Enables advanced code generation and project understanding

**Architecture Notes:**
- Uses Laravel 12's streamlined structure (no app/Http/Middleware/ directory)
- Configuration centralized in bootstrap/app.php
- Auto-discovering commands in app/Console/Commands/
- Models use constructor property promotion and explicit return types
- SQLite database configuration for lightweight development

### 4. Frontend Configuration (React Native/Expo)

**Key Dependencies Configured:**
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "~54.0.9",
    "react": "19.1.0",
    "react-native": "0.81.4",
    "mobile-mcp": "^1.1.0"            // Mobile MCP integration for device testing
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^8.44.0",
    "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^8.44.0",
    "eslint": "^9.36.0",
    "prettier": "^3.6.2",
    "typescript": "~5.9.2"
  }
}
```

**Development Scripts:**
- `npm start`: Start Expo development server
- `npm run android/ios/web`: Platform-specific development
- `npm run format`: Format code using Prettier
- `npm run check`: Run linting and type checking
- `npm run lint`: ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm run type-check`: TypeScript compilation check

**Code Quality Tools:**
- **ESLint**: Configured with TypeScript, React, and React Native plugins
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting for JS/TS/JSON/MD files
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking enabled

### 5. Universal Development Commands

**Problem Solved:**
Need for unified commands that work across both backend and frontend from any directory.

**Solutions Implemented:**

#### A. Claude Code Custom Commands (.claude/commands/)
- **`/format`**: Universal formatting command
  - Runs `composer run format` in backend
  - Runs `npm run format` in frontend
  - Provides visual feedback with emojis and clear messaging

- **`/check`**: Universal quality check command
  - Runs `composer run check` in backend (format + test + route list)
  - Runs `npm run check` in frontend (lint + type-check)
  - Exits with error code if any check fails
  - Provides comprehensive success/failure reporting

#### B. Cross-Platform Shell Scripts (scripts/)
- **format.bat/format.sh**: Windows and Unix format scripts
- **check.bat/check.sh**: Windows and Unix check scripts
- Identical functionality to Claude commands but runnable from command line

**Technical Implementation Details:**
- Uses Node.js child_process.execSync for reliable command execution
- Proper error handling and exit codes
- Working directory management for monorepo structure
- Console output with clear visual indicators (emojis, colors)

        }
    }
}
```

#### E. CLAUDE.md Development Workflow Enhancement
**Updated workflow to mandate context7 usage:**
1. **Documentation lookup**: ALWAYS use context7 MCP when generating code for any part of the tech stack (Laravel 12, React Native 0.81.4, Expo SDK 54.0.9, any imported packages, or any 3rd party libraries or APIs) to get current, version-specific documentation and examples

**Why This Enhancement Was Important:**
- Ensures Claude always has access to current, version-specific documentation
- Provides real-time debugging capabilities for React Native development
- Enables automated testing workflows for mobile applications
- Maintains consistency with latest package versions and best practices

## Important Decisions Made

### 1. Monorepo Structure
**Why:** Easier dependency management, shared tooling, unified development commands
**Implementation:** Separate backend/frontend directories with shared scripts and configuration

### 2. Laravel 12 + React Native Combination
**Why:** Modern, well-supported technologies with excellent documentation and community
**Benefits:** Rapid development, extensive ecosystem, mobile-first approach

### 3. Comprehensive .gitignore
**Why:** Essential for maintaining clean repository and preventing dependency conflicts
**Implementation:** Root-level gitignore covering all major dependency and temporary file patterns

### 4. Universal Command System
**Why:** Simplifies development workflow across different environments and developers
**Implementation:** Multiple approaches (Claude commands, shell scripts) for maximum flexibility

### 5. MCP Integration
**Why:** Enhanced AI-assisted development with current documentation and intelligent code generation
**Implementation:** Backend and frontend MCP tools for comprehensive development support
